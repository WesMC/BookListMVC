# BookListMVC

This example project demonstrates the fundamental aspects of an ASP.NET Core MVC Application.

It demonstrates the following:
* Knowledge of scaffolding related to the configured routing `/controllers/action/index`
* Migrations using Entity Framework to a SQL Server instance
* C.R.U.D operations from the application to the database
* Use of a Third-party DataTable display 

Currently working on using Heroku for deployment.
